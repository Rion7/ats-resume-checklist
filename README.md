# ATS Resume Checklist (2026)

Most resumes are rejected by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) before a human ever sees them.
This checklist helps job seekers make their resumes ATS-friendly and readable by automated systems.

## What is ATS?

Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) are software tools used by employers to collect, parse,
and rank resumes before a recruiter reviews them. Most mid-size and large companies rely
on ATS to filter applications based on keywords, structure, and basic formatting rules.

## Why resumes fail ATS

- Non-standard layouts that break parsing
- Missing or mismatched keywords
- Skills listed without context
- Visual design elements that hide text

## Core ATS Requirements

- Use a simple, single-column layout
- Avoid tables, text boxes, and multi-column designs
- Use standard section headings (Summary, Experience, Skills, Education)
- Choose readable fonts (Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman)
- Keep font size between 10.5–12 pt
- Use bullet points instead of long paragraphs
- Avoid icons, emojis, and special symbols
- Do not use headers or footers
- Save the file as PDF or DOCX (when allowed)

## Keywords & Content

- Match keywords from the job description
- Include both acronyms and full terms (e.g. “API” and “Application Programming Interface”)
- Use action verbs
- Quantify achievements with numbers and metrics
- Avoid keyword stuffing
- Use consistent job titles
- Place key skills in context, not only in a skills list

## Parsing & Formatting Checks

- Test how your resume looks when copied as plain text
- Avoid images, charts, and embedded objects
- Do not hide text or keywords
- Use standard date formats (MM/YYYY or YYYY)
- Avoid excessive styling and colors
